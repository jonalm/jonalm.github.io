# Experience

### Head of Software and Data Science at [Bio-Me](https://bio-me.com/)
_Mar 2023 - present_

### Data Science Architect at [Novelda](https://www.novelda.com/)
_Feb 2019 - Feb 2023_

Designing machine learning algorithms applied to pulse-Doppler radar signals.

### Data Scientist at [Arundo Analytics](https://www.arundo.com/)
_Feb 2017 - Feb 2019_

Building machine learning and statistical models for industrial big data applications.

- Created an application for parsing process and instrumentation diagrams (P&IDs) based on a combination of image recognition techniques and OCR.
- Developed ML model to predict ship hull fouling based on noon report data, which matches the performance of numerically costly CFD based models, for clients in the maritime sector.
- Deployed an application for real time visualization and KPI calculations of sensor data from a production process for a large manufacturer of sewing thread.
- Successfully identified several causes of production failures at a chemical plant using Bayesian multilevel regression.
- Created proof of concept of a virtual multi-flow meter for offshore oil and gas wells, combining physical insight with machine learning methods.


### Postdoc in Biostatistics at [NORMENT (CoE), UiO](https://www.med.uio.no/norment/english/)
_June 2015 – Feb 2017_

- Characterized geno-/phenotype mapping of mental disorders, focusing on polygenic effects.
- Developed statistical methods to identify pleiotropic effects.
- Work involved heavy lifting of big data containing DNA sequences and patient databases, and running analysis on UIO's high-performance computing facilities.

### Research Fellow (Stipendiat) at UiO
_Jan. 2011 – May 2015_

Developed simulations and theoretical models for multiphase flow phenomena, and characterized complex patterning behavior involving granular materials.

- One year residence at [Prof. Ruben Juanes group, MIT](http://juanesgroup.mit.edu/), developing phase field models for simulating surface tension effect.
- One year residence  at [ÉOST, Univ. de Strasbourg](https://eost.unistra.fr/en/).
- Results presented in 4 peer reviewed papers, and at 6 international conferences.

### Mathematics Teacher at Hartvig Nissen VGS
_Sept. 2010 – Dec. 2010_

Taught mathematics and physics at high school level.

### Analyst at Intelligent Decisions AS (now DNV-GL)
_June - July 2007 & 2008_

Improved power consumption models for clients at Nord Pool
based on weather forecasts and historical data.
